#Changelog

-1.5:	!NFiN!TY, TimeMaster, TomNeverwinter, and myself have created a standalone launcher utility for PAX+.
		Features:
			Automatically installs and updates all ini configurations, mech presets, and UPK byte patches to streamline the startup process.
			Allows customization of graphics settings, FOV, cockpit lighting, and more without having to edit ini files.
			Integrates the server browser built by !NFiN!TY and allows launching directly into a server.
			As part of the launcher's functionality, it is bundled with UE Decompressor created by Gildor (https://www.gildor.org/downloads) as well as UPKPatch created by wghost (https://github.com/wghost/UPKUtils) and modified by TimeMaster to work with PAX packages.
